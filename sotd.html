                <p>yeah, i've been pretty obsessed with glass beach lately</p>
                <p>was a choice between Glass Beach and Motions, but GL just means so much to me.</p>
                <p>this song just feels so personal. like they're talking to me lmao. just like the demo of push. that's why i love it so much. it makes me wanna cry.</p>
                <p>i don't really like sharing personal stuff, but this song hits WAY too close to <i>"home"</i>.</p>
                <p>so yeah, <u>CW for some trauma-related stuff, as well as just my personal feelings about the song</u>. if you don't know this song, PLEASE listen to it before reading this. i could put the whole song here, but i decided to put only the lines that i feel a lot.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    i promise you're not wasting<br>

                    are so god damn rough, i understand
                </blockquote>
                <p>i don't have NEARLY enough words to explain how this song makes me feel. just. woah.</p>

                    so please listen clearly, i love you dearly<br>

                <p>some people just don't understand how much hurtful their "advise" might be. because they don't know. yeah, it's not their fault, but it still hurts.</p>

                <p>that's that i want to answer to those "advises" every time. or just every time family theme comes up.</p>

                can we forget about the places that we should be?<br>
we don't have to go home today.

                <p>the feeling when you're afraid to come home is too familliar to me.</p>
                <blockquote>
                i'll sleep on a million couches,<br>
if we have to, to keep us both safe.
                </blockquote>
                <p>i've actually been sleeping on couches instead of a bed for like... 6 years now?... i mean. in span of these 6 years i've slept on an actual bed several times, in hotels, for example, when we went on summer vacation. or when i was vesiting mother, i was sleeping on brother's bed. but i haven't had my own bed this whole time. and i feel like it shows... that place never really been a home for me.</p>

                <p>yeah... those years... the childhood you've never got to experience. being forced to not "act childish" when you were <i>a literal child</i></p>

                <p>i don't have many friends. not that i really can rely on. i have people i enjoy spending time with, yeah. and i'm in good relationships with my classmates too. i know i can feel happy. i have so many times in past year. even though i'm not doing well right now, i hope to feel that joy again. i know i will. i just have to stay strong.</p>
                <blockquote>
                cause hey,<br>
i love you, ok?<br>
it's so hard to say<br>
that i fucking need you too

                <p>... god dammit. i really wanna cry right now.<br>
                    i dont know what i feel. but i feel <i>a lot</i> of it.<br>
                    yknow, i miss this person... that would support me, comfort me, listen to me, let me cry on their shoulder. who would hug me and say that all is going to be okay... someone who would need me as much as i need them.. but that person simply does not exist. i'm too afraid to let anyone too close to me. 
                </p>
                
                <p>like... this song is a lot.</p>
                <p>thank you for reading this, if you did. and even if you didnt, thank you for just being here, hanging on my site!</p>
                <p>i will probably delete most of the commentary when i'll put another song, because it is very personal.</p>

                <p>so i was in VC yesterday and <a href="https://webcatz.neocities.org/">june</a> made me listen to plastic death (and i loved it)</p>
                <p>i added this song into my playlist right away (as well as cul-de-sac)</p>
                <p>then i re-listened to this song while reading the lyrics and i love this song!</p>
                <p>this specific part was playing in my head in exam today actually:</p>
                <blockquote>Plastic death, plastic death<br>
                    Suck the marrow till there's nothing left, nothing left<br>
                    Send every message as an SOS, SOS<br>
                    I love you better when you're plasticine, in stark submission<br>

                <p>despite chonny stating that this song's message is "on the nose", i did not read that lmao. i guess the main reason is that we experience music through out own experience. but hell yes!!

                <p>When i was singing along (as i do) my voice kept cracking parcially bcs i was singing for hours and not drinking any water, but also bcs i was singing too high bcs of singer's high voice ToT</p>
                <p>This song feels like something liminal. Or matric-like.</p>
                <p>Artificial sun, glitchy leaves, empty places, feeling cold despite 85F/30C weather.</p>

                <p>firstly, this song reminds me of one person.</p>
                <p>secondly, makes me think that there's only 1 more year 'til i turn 18.</p>
                <p>have mixed feelings about it.</p>
