            <p class="bold">(formerly known as Silly Bunny's World)</p>
            <p>this is a passionate project of mine. it's a game about this guy named ash.</p>
            <p>you may have seen this meme on pinterest, which became my most popular pin for some reason</p>
            <p>to answer some question: no, this game is not related/inspired by omori, all on this image was a coincidence and pictures specifically picked to somewhat match</p>
            <p>i really just made this for funnies, plus only my friends knew about SBW back then</p>

            <p class="biggest">some question i've been asked!</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="bigger">Q: where do i find more info about it?</p>
            <p>A: here? maybe?</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="bigger">Q: what's the lore?</p>
            <p>A: i don't know, mate. i'm confused as heck myself.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="bigger">Q: when does it come out?</p>
            <p>A: Schrodinger's game: is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, of quantum superposition. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical readhead may be considered simultaneously both being made and not, while it is unobserved in a closed box, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic mental helth issue that may or may not occur.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="bigger">Q: are you still working on it?</p>
            <p>A: well. not exactly? i'm trying to work on the lore, which has been scrapped and re-written (jk i don't actually write lore, i just make stuff up and try to put it together (unsuccessfully as you might see))</p>
            <p>I know very little of coding so far, and don't have time & energy to study it right now. also personal problems :p</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="bigger">Q: what does "readhead" mean?</p>
            <p>A: "readhead" was originally a misspelling of a phrase "red head" from a doodle i drew for a joke. then we decided it sounds cool and rolled with it. (also i wanted to change the temporary name "silly bunny's world}</p>
